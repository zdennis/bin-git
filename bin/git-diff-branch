# This is used to see differences between your current topic branch/head
# and a target source branch/ref.
#
# The default is to compare a local branch against its remote upstream. E.g.
#
#   git diff-branch # => git range-diff -p @{u}...head
#
# You can pass in an argument to change the source:
#
#  git diff-branch master # => git range-diff -p master...head

base_ref=${1:-"@{u}"}
git range-diff -p "${base_ref}"...head
